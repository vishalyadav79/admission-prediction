Introduction
This project predicts the likelihood of a student's admission into a graduate program based on various features such as GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation strength, undergraduate GPA, research experience, and more. The objective is to develop a machine learning model that can help universities or applicants estimate the chances of admission based on these parameters.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [INSERT SOURCE]. It contains the following features:

GRE Score: Graduate Record Exam scores (out of 340)
TOEFL Score: Test of English as a Foreign Language scores (out of 120)
University Rating: Rating of the university (out of 5)
Statement of Purpose: Strength of the Statement of Purpose (out of 5)
Letter of Recommendation: Strength of the Recommendation Letter (out of 5)
Undergraduate GPA: GPA in the undergraduate program (out of 10)
Research Experience: Binary value indicating research experience (0 or 1)
Chance of Admit: Probability of admission (ranging from 0 to 1)

Dependencies
The project requires the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
jupyter
You can install these dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/admission-prediction.git
cd admission-prediction
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Open the exploratory_analysis.ipynb notebook to explore the data and visualize relationships between features.

Training the Model:
Run the train_model.py script to preprocess the data and train the machine learning model:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/train_model.py
The trained model will be saved in the models/ directory.

Making Predictions:
Use the predict.py script to make predictions on new data:

bash
Copy code
python scripts/predict.py --input <input_data.csv> --output <output_predictions.csv>
Model Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R²). The evaluation results are included in the train_model.py script.
